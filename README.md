# Gerardo Barcenas Jr. - Portfolio Website

## Introduction

I am Gerardo Barcenas, a passionate software developer. This portfolio showcases my journey as a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science from California State University East Bay. Through this website, I aim to highlight my diverse projects and skills in software development, web design, and application development.

## Building Process

The portfolio website was built using a combination of front-end technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The responsive and user-friendly layout was achieved using custom SCSS (Sassy CSS) styling. To ensure smooth and interactive user experiences, JavaScript libraries such as jQuery were integrated.

The use of SCSS, a superset of CSS with enhanced features like variables, nested rules, and mixins, facilitated the organization and maintainability of the stylesheets. SCSS allowed me to efficiently structure the project's CSS, making it easier to customize and update the design across the entire website.

The site's design prioritizes simplicity, readability, and visual appeal. I crafted the content layout to provide visitors with a seamless journey through my projects, work experiences, and areas of interest. The use of animations and transitions adds a touch of interactivity, enhancing the overall browsing experience.
